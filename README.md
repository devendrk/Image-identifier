## Problems I faced duirng this project.

- Got several errors while deploying the function, with reading the error, googling finally able to deploy.
- Used 2 different storage (fire base and Realtime database) for sake of learning, But had to spend a bit of time to read the docs and apply it to fetch the result of analyzed image.

## I would improve make following imporvement if I would have enough time.

- would use O-auth and email authentication with proper statemanagement eg. redux or Context ApI.
- Would learn more about best practices of Google cloud functions, database security rules and apply them.
- Would make more nicer ui components.
- Would add test
- Would make Native app
